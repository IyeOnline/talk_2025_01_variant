This is a talk I gave in the January 2025 C++ User Group Meeting in Frankfurt.

* [slides.md](slides.md) is the talks slide source and mostly readable when rednered as markdown
* [rendered_slides/index.html](rendered_slides/index.html) are the rendered slides
* the rest of the repo is the source code from the talk in compilable fashion.
